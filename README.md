# 2025

Kof's sketchbook year 2025, sketches are build with [Processing](http://processing.org) software.

The sketches are organized by months of year. This structure can make feel of some order, which in fact is false. It is rather mess with all ideas and unfinished concepts placed in kind of plain time-line space. Feel free to dig in and recycle anything useful for you.. when you find something like this, do not hesitate to contact me, or use whatever what fits your current need.

## Sketches Running On-line

There is a kind of selection hosted on [Open Processing](http://www.openprocessing.org/user/3942), these are mostly a bit *obsolete* Java applets selected for being able to run in a browser.

## Rendered Outputs

Other way of on-line presentation is quite heavily re-compressed (h264) videos, they are more widely accepted due to more "standard media form". The most of these outputs are available on [Vimeo](https://vimeo.com/kof/videos).

But please, remember you had been warned, there is plenty of code with very varying *qualities* .. to be more exact, some of programs are complete waste of time to run or even compile ))

Some of the videos and rendered outputs are available @ [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@krystofpesek2962/videos), they sould be linked to sources if possible, maybe in some future.

Clone them all /w simple command
```
for i in 20{07,08,09,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25}; do echo $i; git clone
git@github.com:K0F/$i.git ; done
```

*Enjoy, and feel free to recycle!*

*light be with you*
